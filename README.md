#### Timings

*10 cost* -> Tank **back slot**

*When arros ult hits 10 seconds left quite exactly* -> Epic Flyers **back slot**

*10 cost* -> Squids **back slot**

⚠️**If there is an Abom/Torodor, you may need to leave a slight delay between squids and bugs, to avoid stuns. In the case of Torodor, unlucky RNG will probably make you fail** ⚠️

*6 cost* -> Boom bugsx2 **front slot**

⚠️**If arro is almost back up to his ult, tempo with a tank instead of immediately lego flyers** ⚠️

*10 cost* -> Lego flyerx2 **front slot**

*5 cost* -> Epic flyer **doesn't matter, you won**

The two ground units don't really matter, they just bait stuff.


#### Timings

*As soon as valk & silas ults are ready* -> Any bait unit **Doesn't matter**
*16 left on valk ult* -> Lego Flyer x2 **Back slot**
*Silas ult up* -> Any bait unit **Doesn't matter**
