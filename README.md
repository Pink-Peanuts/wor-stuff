#### Timings

*10 cost* -> Tank **back slot**

*When arros ult hits 10 seconds left quite exactly* -> Epic Flyers **back slot**

*10 cost* -> Squids **back slot**

⚠️**If there is an Abom/Torodor, you may need to leave a slight delay between squids and bugs, to avoid stuns. In the case of Torodor, unlucky RNG will probably make you fail** ⚠️

*6 cost* -> Boom bugsx2 **front slot**

⚠️**If arro is almost back up to his ult, tempo with a tank instead of immediately lego flyers** ⚠️

*10 cost* -> Lego flyerx2 **front slot**

*5 cost* -> Epic flyer **doesn't matter, you won**

The two ground units don't really matter, they just bait stuff.


#### Timings

*As soon as valk & silas ults are ready* -> Any bait unit **Doesn't matter**

*16 left on valk ult* -> Lego Flyer x2 **Back slot**

*Silas ult up* -> Any bait unit **Doesn't matter**

*10 Cost* -> Epic flyers **Back slot**

*6 cost* -> Rare flyers **Front slot**

<summary> Generic Entrance stacks </summary>

⚠️This is one that is somewhat BP dependant, it can work great, just as it can fail if used in the wrong situation. Use on teams that will become terrible once the ults start popping, but avoid on teams with a BP that is too high compared to yours ⚠️

**I would only ever recommend using this one if you are confident in what you are doing, and have tested it in a few friendly faceoffs to understand the general idea**

Last two aren't that important, and can be swapped around based on what you need after the first tank/passive/ult has been forced.

#### Timings

*IN THE FIRST HALF SECOND OF THE GAME* -> Rare fighter x2 **Front slot**

⚠️**Seriously, the second the game starts, you should be spamming to pause the game, get your mouse ready to hover a unit, unpause, immediately click on the unit, and drop a double stack of these fighters before the cost can even get to 7 1/4. THE ENTIRE PREMISE hinges on them reaching and killing the tank before the ults start raining down ⚠️

⚠️The timings here are more indicative than anything else. You need to apply some judgement here for the rest. Is a silas ult still up and it will hit your melees? Tempo a bit. Is praetus ult up soon? Tempo a bit. Stuff like that. This can't be exactly defined, unless I start listing them all, and for this strat I don't think it's worth it to do that. ⚠️

*9 cost* -> Dagger girls **Front slot**

*6 cost* -> Axe men **Front slot**

At this point, you should be past the first tank, or burned enough of their passives/ults/revives that you're in the clear.

Either send in another fighter stack if you need that tank dead, or mages to clear up a clumped formation, or flyers to get over and kill the backline valk before next ult... Honestly at this point the world is your oyster, and you should be in the clear.

#### Timings

- *Immediately* -> Mage tank **Front slot**
  
- *10 cost* -> Dagger girls **Front slot** Axe men **Back slot**
  
- *3 cost* -> Healer **Front slot**

⚠️Use some judgement here, if you have time to get dogs through before Marri pops her ult, send them in, if not (she's >75% on her ult bar) wait to send them out

- *When Marri's ult is not a risk* -> Dogs **Front slot**

- *5 cost* -> Dogs **Front slot**

#### Timings

*10 cost* -> Maw **Back slot**

⚠️

Here it really depends a lot, I sent in a tank, I'm not even sure if there is any value to this, you might be able to go straight for fighters

It may be best to also send in healers together, or sooner, or really it depends on the situation. This is what worked for me

⚠️

*5 cost* -> Tank **Back slot**

*4 cost* -> Healer **Front slot**

*4 cost* -> Healer **Front slot**

*Pnce the platform unit is dead* -> Dogs **Front slot**

*5 cost (not into mauls ult)* -> Dogs **Front slot**

*Whatever* -> IDK **Random bullshit go**

*6 cost* -> Boom bugs x2 **Front slot**

*5 Cost* -> Epic Tank **Back slot**

*6 cost* -> Axe men **First slot**

*6 cost* -> Axe men **First slot**

At this point it should be done already, but if you need to send in dogs, you probably lost, and best to send them out as soon as you can

Epic flyers first, lego second, the rest legitimately doesn't matter. C.f the above Khamet/Arro defence

#### Timings

*10 cost* -> Mage Tank **Back slot**

🕐The exact time of the line below varies, you want the lego flyers to arrive after all the ults, lego flyers take roughly 30 seconds to arrive from the middle slot

*2:13 left* -> Lego Flyer x2 **Middle slot**

*10 cost* -> Dagger girlsx2 **Front slot**

❔ Kind of depends on who is alive, epic flyers worked for me here, but if it's a different mage than Ajax, units other than epic flyers might be the better option.

*10 cost* -> Epic flyers **Front slot**

#### Timings

*When all ults are up* -> Fat fighter/tank/whatever can survive to trigger ults **Front slot**

*Khamet 7-8 left on ult* ->  Dagger girls x2 **Front slot**

*Dagger girls at tank* -> Epic dogs x1 **Front slot**

You should have won, if you didn't, the path should be clear, if not, you can probably just send lego flyers through, or any number of approaches.

**Plan ahead, take what you might need to get through, Aracha at the very least should be dead**

#### Timings

*ASAP* -> Necro (What I used, probably better options, so they survive for sure to trigger zili ult) **Front slot**

*2:23 left* -> Rare tank x2 **Back slot**

*10 cost* -> Epic dog x2 **Front slot**

At this point it was done. **BUT**, if for any reason this was not enough, you should still have a necro, lego flyers, and rare dogs. Try to slip in between ults with lego flyers to take out another DPS, and then go for a necro + dog swarm I guess
