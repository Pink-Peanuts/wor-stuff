#### Timings

*10 cost* -> Tank **back slot**

*When arros ult hits 10 seconds left quite exactly* -> Epic Flyers **back slot**

*10 cost* -> Squids **back slot**

⚠️**If there is an Abom/Torodor, you may need to leave a slight delay between squids and bugs, to avoid stuns. In the case of Torodor, unlucky RNG will probably make you fail** ⚠️

*6 cost* -> Boom bugsx2 **front slot**

⚠️**If arro is almost back up to his ult, tempo with a tank instead of immediately lego flyers** ⚠️

*10 cost* -> Lego flyerx2 **front slot**

*5 cost* -> Epic flyer **doesn't matter, you won**

The two ground units don't really matter, they just bait stuff.


#### Timings

*As soon as valk & silas ults are ready* -> Any bait unit **Doesn't matter**

*16 left on valk ult* -> Lego Flyer x2 **Back slot**

*Silas ult up* -> Any bait unit **Doesn't matter**

*10 Cost* -> Epic flyers **Back slot**

*6 cost* -> Rare flyers **Front slot**

<summary> Generic Entrance stacks </summary>

⚠️This is one that is somewhat BP dependant, it can work great, just as it can fail if used in the wrong situation. Use on teams that will become terrible once the ults start popping, but avoid on teams with a BP that is too high compared to yours ⚠️

**I would only ever recommend using this one if you are confident in what you are doing, and have tested it in a few friendly faceoffs to understand the general idea**

Last two aren't that important, and can be swapped around based on what you need after the first tank/passive/ult has been forced.

#### Timings

*IN THE FIRST HALF SECOND OF THE GAME* -> Rare fighter x2 **Front slot**

⚠️**Seriously, the second the game starts, you should be spamming to pause the game, get your mouse ready to hover a unit, unpause, immediately click on the unit, and drop a double stack of these fighters before the cost can even get to 7 1/4. THE ENTIRE PREMISE hinges on them reaching and killing the tank before the ults start raining down ⚠️

⚠️The timings here are more indicative than anything else. You need to apply some judgement here for the rest. Is a silas ult still up and it will hit your melees? Tempo a bit. Is praetus ult up soon? Tempo a bit. Stuff like that. This can't be exactly defined, unless I start listing them all, and for this strat I don't think it's worth it to do that. ⚠️

*9 cost* -> Dagger girls **Front slot**

*6 cost* -> Axe men **Front slot**

At this point, you should be past the first tank, or burned enough of their passives/ults/revives that you're in the clear.

Either send in another fighter stack if you need that tank dead, or mages to clear up a clumped formation, or flyers to get over and kill the backline valk before next ult... Honestly at this point the world is your oyster, and you should be in the clear.

- *5 cost* -> Dogs **Front slot**

#### Timings

*10 cost* -> Maw **Back slot**

⚠️

Here it really depends a lot, I sent in a tank, I'm not even sure if there is any value to this, you might be able to go straight for fighters

It may be best to also send in healers together, or sooner, or really it depends on the situation. This is what worked for me

⚠️

*5 cost* -> Tank **Back slot**

*4 cost* -> Healer **Front slot**

*4 cost* -> Healer **Front slot**

*Pnce the platform unit is dead* -> Dogs **Front slot**

*5 cost (not into mauls ult)* -> Dogs **Front slot**

*Whatever* -> IDK **Random bullshit go**
