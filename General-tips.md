# General GvG tips


## Defense

### Gearing 

- We have gear plans available now, **I highly recommend taking apart all of your gear after saving your PvE sets, and setting up dedicated GvG gear plans**. Equip them before GvG starts, this should help improve your defense significantly

- When you are setting up gear for DPS champs in GvG, **ATK%** is king for DPS champs, speed and crit being close seconds. Crit damage & Regen are a luxury you think about after

- As usual **sets are not always the best option**. A well built champ with a focus on ATK, will outperform a middling champ with a set, and mostly cdmg pieces
