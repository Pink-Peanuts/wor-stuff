# Gear cleansing

## Preface

Most of the general concepts stay true throughout the game, the question only really becomes how strict you want to be depending on where you are at. That being said, don't take anything at face value, and pick and choose the information you find reasonable.

Personally, any piece that seems like it could be useful gets rolled to +8, you can generally see at +8 if the rolls on the piece will be overall good rolls, or shit.

## First step

From here, you're going to want to start off with opening the quick select, and at the very least using the left side option once, and selling all the selected gear. 

⚠️Some sets, like invig, morale, and possibly some others that I can't think of right now, have some value even if the gear is shit. Make sure you always keep one or two sets of these, even with flat stats, so lock them before doing this. ⚠️

Ignore the second option for now, we will get back to it later.

⚠️I'll mostly be talking about jewellry, but the same concept minus primaries applies to left side pieces, with the exception that CDMG can't usually roll on main weapons, and speed doesn't usually roll on chest pieces ⚠️

## Second Step

You'll be doing a lot of this over multiple gear/stat combos

### Healers

Depending on where you're at, either only do this for healer sets or do it for all sets, that will be up to you to determine.

#### Healer sets

- 3 Piece : Invigoration, Morale, Asclepius, Mana spring, Glacier arguably
- 2 Piece : Light's Grace, Salvation, Life force, Whirlwind, Calamity

#### Choosing items to roll

Cycle through the combinations of primaries/secondaries from the list below. 
For most healers, the 3 most important stats will be Main stat/Healing effect/Attack speed. And arguably, out of the 3 of those, healing effect has the highest ceiling if you play with Elysian Epitaph.

Any piece fitting 3 4 or 5 of these stats on it, is a decent piece, lock it. As you progress, you can get more picky on how many it should have.

##### Primary
- Main stat (HP/ATK, maybe in the future DEF)
- Healing effect
- Attack speed
- Rage regen

##### Secondary
- Main stat
- Healing effect
- Attack speed
- Rage regen

### Tanks

Same logic as above, choose between tank only sets or not


#### Tank sets

- 3 Piece : Tempered Will, Guardian, Asclepius, Mana spring
- 2 Piece : Immortal Warrior, Life Force

#### Choosing items to roll

Cycle through the combinations of primaries/secondaries from the list below. 

For Tanks, it is pretty much non negotiable to have DEF% and HP% on a piece. You will probably want more HP% pieces overall in your build. 
Speed/Regen are nice additions for some tanks like Brokkir and Baron, but are useless on some others like Olague. 
Flat Life and Def are always nice

Any piece fitting 3 4 or 5 of these stats on it, is a decent piece, lock it. As you progress, you can get more picky on how many it should have.

##### Primary
- HP%
- DEF%

##### Secondary
- HP%
- DEF%
- Speed
- Rage regen
- HP
- DEF

### Intermediary step

Depending on how far along you are, you can use this junction to go back to the sell screen, and sell all gear that does not have thumbs up. The thumbs up tends to not work great for healer/tank sets, but it will pretty much always catch DPS gear with 2-3+ relevant substats.

### Damage dealers

Same logic as above, choose between tank only sets or not


#### Damage sets

- 3 Piece : There are way too many, you know which ones they are
- 2 Piece : Warlord, Vengeance, Whirlwind, Calamity, Might

#### Choosing items to roll

Cycle through the combinations of primaries/secondaries from the list below. 

Damage dealers almost all follow the same basis : You're going to want mainly Main Stat % primary pieces, some CDMG ones, rarely you can get away with Crate ones if you have good left side gear that does not have crit on it, and atk speed is a bit niche but usable.

Any piece fitting 3 4 or 5 of these stats on it, is a decent piece, lock it. As you progress, you can get more picky on how many it should have.

⚠️Jewellry pieces that have the main stat in neither the main or the secondary are probably not worth using at all⚠️

##### Primary
- Main stat (Mostly ATK really, a few DEF/HP champs out there, but yeah)
- CDMG
- CRate
- Speed

##### Secondary
- Main stat
- CDMG
- CRate
- Speed
- Regen
- Flat Main Stat


## Third step

Once you have the initial parts sorted out, you can select all the unlock & not upgraded gear, and sell it all. Then you can roll everything you just locked, and sell it as you go. How strict you are on stat rolls is for you to determine, but by the time you're done, you should be sub 500 pieces of gear, unless you're Chi and really have a fuck ton of genuinely good gear
